# Face Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Welcome to my Face Generation project! In this project, I've built a custom generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate new images of faces, particularly showcasing faces of celebrities from the CelebA dataset.

## Project Overview

### Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to leverage the power of GANs to create high-quality facial images. After training the GAN model for a few epochs, you'll witness the model's ability to generate realistic and convincing faces.

### How to Use
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Open the notebook file, `dlnd_face_generation_starter.ipynb`, and follow the detailed instructions provided within.

2. The project is organized into several sections:

    - **Data Pipeline**: Implement a data augmentation function and a custom dataset class to load and preprocess the images.

    - **Model Implementation**: Build a custom generator and a custom discriminator to create your GAN architecture.

    - **Loss Functions and Gradient Penalty**: Decide on appropriate loss functions and whether to employ gradient penalty.

    - **Training Loop**: Implement the training loop and choose a training strategy.

Feel free to revisit any section to fine-tune your model or data pipeline based on the results you obtain. Building a deep learning model, especially a GAN, is an iterative process, so don't hesitate to experiment and improve your project.

## Conclusion

Creating a deep learning model capable of generating realistic faces is an exciting challenge. I hope you find this project as engaging and rewarding as I did. Good luck, and happy face generation!
